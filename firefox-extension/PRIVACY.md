# Privacy Policy - Monitor de Bloqueos de Red

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Overview

"Monitor de Bloqueos de Red" is a Firefox browser extension that helps identify domains blocked by DNS whitelists or firewalls. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and does not transmit any information to external servers.

## Data Storage

| Data Type | Storage Location | Retention |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Blocked domains list | Browser memory (RAM) | Cleared when tab closes |
| Tab-specific state | Browser memory (RAM) | Cleared on navigation |
| User preferences | None stored | N/A |

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `webRequest` | Monitor network errors to detect blocked domains |
| `webNavigation` | Reset state when navigating to new pages |
| `tabs` | Display blocked domain count per tab |
| `clipboardWrite` | Allow copying domain list to clipboard |
| `nativeMessaging` | Optional local communication with whitelist system |
| `<all_urls>` | Monitor all websites for blocked resources |

### Why `<all_urls>`?

This extension needs access to all URLs because blocked resources can come from any domain. Without this permission, the extension could not detect third-party resources being blocked on websites you visit.

## Native Messaging

If you enable the optional native messaging feature:

- Communication occurs **only** with a local Python script on your computer
- The script queries your local whitelist configuration
- **No data leaves your computer**

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in the extension's repository and the "Last updated" date above.
