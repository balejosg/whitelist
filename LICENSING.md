# Licensing Strategy

OpenPath is dual-licensed to ensure both community freedom and sustainable development.

## 1. Upstream License: AGPL-3.0

The open-source version of OpenPath is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

### Why AGPL-3.0?
*   **Transparency**: Requires full source code disclosure for any modifications.
*   **Network Protection**: If you run a modified version of OpenPath as a network service (SaaS), you **must** make your source code available to your users.
*   **Traceability**: Ensures that derivative works acknowledge the original source and maintain the same freedoms.

### Perfect for:
*   Educational institutions (K-12, Universities)
*   Non-profits
*   Internal use in companies
*   Individuals and hobbyists

## 2. Commercial License (Downstream SaaS)

For commercial entities wishing to offer OpenPath as a paid "Software as a Service" (SaaS) or embed it in proprietary products without the copyleft obligations of AGPL-3.0, a **Commercial License** is available.

### Benefits:
*   **Exemption from Copyleft**: No requirement to release your modifications or proprietary code.
*   **Dedicated Support**: Access to priority support and SLAs.
*   **Legal certainty**: Clear indemnification and assurances for enterprise deployments.
